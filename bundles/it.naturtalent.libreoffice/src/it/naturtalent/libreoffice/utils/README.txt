============================

This directory contains utility classes which help simplify the use
of different areas of the LibreOffice API.

I will be adding/modifying files in this directory as I write-up 
each chapter so please keep downloading the latest version. 
The version date is at the top of this file.

This directory must be called "Utils" and be in the same directory as
the example directories.

You can compile these files using "compile.bat", but this isn't
really necessary since they'll be compiled as a side-effect of 
compiling the examples in other directories.

Make sure that the paths in the batch file refer to the 
correct locations for your downloads of LibreOffice, 
Java, JNA, and these Utils classes.
For details, read:
   "Installing the code for "Java LibreOffice Programming"
    http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jlop/install.html

Compilation:
> compile *.java
